# Social_Linked_Project
Sportsfolk is an innovative, transparent and reliable web application, designed to join sports with folks. The idea is to connect people with similar interests in sports and give them an opportunity to express their passions in an actual playing field. Through these sports, our goal is to encourage outdoor activities and allow for a healthy companionship grounded on passions, pleasure and unforgettable adventurous moments. This project was developed under the course “PlanSpiel Web Engineering”, Web Engineering, TU Chemnitz.

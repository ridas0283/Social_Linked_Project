# Social_Linked_Project_Sportsflok
Sportsfolk is an innovative, transparent and reliable web application, designed to join sports with folks.

Through these sports, our goal is to encourage outdoor activities and allow for a healthy companionship grounded on passions, pleasure and unforgettable adventurous moments. This project was developed under the course “PlanSpiel Web Engineering”, Web Engineering, TU Chemnitz.
